# Algorithms-With-Swift
Writing this project for reference and learning purposes. Have started with simple algorithms, will try to cover more as we go on this journey

## Common Algorithms

### Array

- [Reverse an Array](ReverseArray.swift)
- [Two Sum Problem](TwoSumProblem.swift)
- [Non-decreasing Array](LeetCode665.swift)
- [Find Third Maximum in Array](FindThirdMax.swift)

### Strings

- [Balanced Parantheses](Balance_Parantheses.swift)

### Sorting

### Searching
- [Binary Search](BinarySearch.swift)
