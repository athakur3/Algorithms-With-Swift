# Algorithms-With-Swift
Writing this project for reference and learning purposes. Have started with simple algorithms, will try to cover more as we go on this journey

## Common Algorithms

##### Binary Search -> BinarySearch.swift
##### Reverse an Array -> ReverseArray.swift
##### Two Sum Problem -> TwoSumProblem.swift
##### Non-decreasing Array -> LeetCode665.swift
##### Find Third Maximum in Array -> FindThirdMax.swift
##### Balanced Parantheses in string -> [Balanced Parantheses](Balanced_Parantheses.swift)
